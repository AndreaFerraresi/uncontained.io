# Content Model
Uncontained.io guides help individuals, communities, and companies embrace open source software. It explains not only how to accomplish a task, but why you'd want to, and how that task fits into a larger story of organizations undergoing a digital transformation.

This content was originally created and curated by Red Hat's PaaS Community of Practice, and covers topics that are very relevant to Red Hat users, but it is not specific to Red Hat products.

Everything written on uncontained.io should fall into one of the following categories.

## Articles

Simply put, an _article_ is any single piece of content.
- A `title`
- A `date`
- An `author` (or authors)
- A `category` (see below for Category options)
- Optionally:
  - One or more `tags`
  - One or more `collections` that the article is a part of

While meant to be read from beginning to end, articles have a table of contents to help the reader quickly skim the content and find a relevant subsection.

### Implementation Guides

_Implementation guides_ are long form articles that provide an approach to solving an organizational problem using technology. These articles may have multiple contributors, contain visuals and anecdotes to illustrate their point and may provide opinionated guidance.

### Add-Ons

An _add-on_ article (a.k.a an Appendix) is a piece of content that is associated with another article, but would have broken up the flow or the primary content or otherwise makes more sense to live separately. Typically, an add-on should start by stating the assumption that the reader first reads and understands the originating article before getting into the meat of the content.

### Tutorials

A tutorial is a walk-through using commands and code that are used to teach a concept.

### Deep Dives (a.k.a Funamentals Guides)

A _deep dive_ or _fundamentals guide_ will cover a specific topic area in order to provide some fundamental base knowledge that will be needed or assumed in other implementation guides (for example, "Getting Started with Containers").

## Collections

A _collection_ is an entirely different content format, intended to provide a way of grouping together multiple articles in a way that provides a more wholistic message. We are still in development of the _collections_ model right now, and will post more soon.

## Design Elements

If you're writing an article or tutorial guide, here are some smaller design elements that enrich the content experience. We use them to draw the reader's attention and break up walls of text; therefore, they should all get some sort of visual treatment.

### Pull quote

We use quotes in the guide to illustrate a point through an anecdote. Pull quotes should highlight real people and their experiences.

### Image

Images help visually illustrate a point. Some images are instructive, such as a graph. Other images are visual, such as a webpage screenshot. We should have lots of these.

### Data vignette

Whereas pull quotes and images help ground ideas in something specific and concrete, data vignettes help connect ideas to bigger systems.

Data vignettes are limited so as not to overwhelm, but contain just enough information to help readers understand why they should pay attention to a certain idea.

### Historical vignette

Historical vignettes are fun anecdotes that keep a reader's attention. They make community members the heroes of the story, and help pass down cultural knowledge.

### Content taxonomy tags

Content taxonomy tags are categories or classifications (a term or phrase) that is added to a web publication that relates the specific publication to other contents that are similarly tagged.

### Tag clouds

A tag cloud (word cloud, or weighted list in visual design) is a visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color.
